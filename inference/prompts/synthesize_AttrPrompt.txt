STEP 1 Attribute dimension and Attribute value (by GPT-4): 
(1) in general 

Prompt: “Which attribute dimensions do you consider vital in creating human-readable lexicographic definitions given some input?”

Response:...

Key attributes:
- Exactness: Ensure the definition accurately reflects the meaning of the term without ambiguity.
- Conciseness: Keep definitions brief and to the point, without sacrificing essential information.
- Specificity: Avoid overly broad definitions by providing specific details that distinguish the term from similar ones.
- Consistency: Use consistent terminology within and across definitions to avoid confusion. Maintain a consistent style and format across all definitions to aid readability and comprehension.
- Contextual Information:
    - Usage Notes: Include notes on common usage, connotations, and any regional or dialectal variations.
    - Part of Speech: Clearly indicate the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to provide grammatical context.
- Readability: 
    - Sentence Structure: Use straightforward sentence structures and avoid overly complex syntax.
    - Typography: Employ clear and readable typography, including proper spacing, fonts, and layout to enhance visual clarity.
- Cultural and Social Sensitivity:
    - Neutrality: Ensure definitions are neutral and unbiased, avoiding culturally or socially insensitive language.
    - Inclusivity: Consider diverse perspectives and avoid definitions that may be exclusionary or offensive to any group.
- Etymology and Origins (if relevant): Etymology and Origins (if relevant):

STEP 2 Detailed Prompt Templates
(在这一步需要先对STEP 1得到的Attribute dimension做筛选；然后对于每个dimension下面的value，让GPT做进一步阐述)


(1) synthesize context
Suppose you are a lexicologist. Please write ?(# number) sentences in X dataset following the requirements below:
1. Should include the word {target_word} and the part of speech of the {target_word} should be {POS_target_word}
2. Should be in length between {length:min-words} and {length:max-words} words;
3. The writing style of the sentence should be {style};
4. ...



(2) synthesize definition -> 
Suppose you are a lexicologist. Please write ? definitions in X dataset following the requirements below:
1. You are given a reference definition {referent_definition};
2. Should be in length between {length:min-words} and {length:max-words} words;



(3) synthesize definition-context pair -> better sample quality
Suppose you are a lexicologist. Please write ? definitions and the corresponding example sentences in X dataset following the requirements below:
1. Should include the word {target_word} and the part of speech of the {target_word} should be {POS_target_word}
2. Should be in length between {length:min-words} and {length:max-words} words;
3. The output format should always be json;
4. ...
